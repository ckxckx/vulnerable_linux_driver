# vulnerable_linux_driver

An intentionally vulnerable linux driver for research purposes/practice in kernel exploit dev

This is based off the awesome work from the hacksys team who did the vulnerable windows driver: https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver

These are not CTF style challenges, the vulnerabilities are extremely obvious, the focus is one understanding kernel exploit dev.
